## **Project Description**

The **Stock Price Prediction & Investment Recommendation System** is a data science–based project designed to analyze historical stock market data and predict future stock prices using machine learning techniques. The project aims to assist investors in making informed investment decisions by providing **Buy, Sell, or Hold recommendations** based on predicted price movements.

The system collects real-time and historical stock data from **Yahoo Finance** using the Python `yfinance` library. The collected data includes attributes such as Open, High, Low, Close prices, and trading Volume. Data preprocessing techniques are applied to clean the dataset and handle missing values. Technical indicators such as **Moving Averages (MA_10 and MA_50)** are generated to capture market trends and reduce price fluctuations.

A **Linear Regression** machine learning model is trained on the processed dataset to predict the closing price of the stock. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance using metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **R² score**. Based on the comparison between the predicted price and the current market price, the system generates an investment recommendation.

The project also includes graphical visualizations such as stock price trends and actual vs predicted price comparisons to enhance understanding and interpretation of results. This system demonstrates the practical application of data science and machine learning concepts in the financial domain. Although the model does not guarantee profit due to market volatility, it provides valuable insights into stock price trends and supports data-driven investment decisions.
